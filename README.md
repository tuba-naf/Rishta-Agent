# Rishta-Agent


    🧕💞 Meet AI-Powered Rishta Wali Auntie 💝💍
Because even shaadi proposals deserve a tech upgrade in 2025!

💬 What She Does:
Your classic Rishta Auntie — now rebooted with a Python brain and API superpowers:

✔️ Asks for your preferred minimum age 🤵
✔️ Preparing to stalk LinkedIn profiles like a pro (it’s research, not stalking… 👀)
✔️ Sends WhatsApp proposals instantly 🤞
✔️ Ends with a wholesome “Shukriya beta” ❤️

🔧 What Powers Her:
A clever mix of modern tools with desi flair:

🧠 Python — for all the rishta logic
💬 Chainlit — for real-time Auntie conversations
🔍 Google Custom Search API — LinkedIn search (training in progress 😅)
📲 UltraMsg API — WhatsApp messages, straight to your phone
🤖 Gemini AI — for natural, desi-style chatting
🔐 Dotenv — keeping Auntie’s secrets safe

🔑 What I Learned:
This project helped me explore real-world technical skills with a fun twist:

✅ Tool calling
✅ API integration
✅ Building conversational agents
✅ Managing application state
✅ Creative storytelling through code

💡 How It Came Together:
Blending culture and code, this started as a quirky idea and evolved into a hands-on learning experience. It was a joy to turn something so traditional into something delightfully digital.

I call it: “Rishta Agent”
Where tech meets tradition — and Auntie brings rishtas via WhatsApp, not your living room.

✨ From rishta gossip to rishta tech — no more staged smiles.
Because you deserve better than a tray of biscuits and forced small talk.
